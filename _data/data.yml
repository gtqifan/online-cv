    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi there :) I am Qifan Yang, and I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Actively looking for an internship position where I can utilize my 5 years of CS experience in backend developing and/or networking in Summer 2023. 

      I had a solid foundation and gained more experience in fundamental or low-level CS branches, such as networking, operating systems, and databases. 

      Previous member of Leaf, a startup team developing note-taking software that aims to speed up the input with the help of deep learning from lecture materials. Also was a member of the tech-dev section of Georgia Tech China Student and Scholar Association (GTCSSA) and the software we developed has benefited hundreds of new Tech students to get familiar with the campus and surroundings. During my internship at ADP, the backend service that I built for a client data questionnaire will be used and deployed in the real production environment.
